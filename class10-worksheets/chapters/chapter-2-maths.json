      "content": "## Welcome to the Round World!\n\nHey there! Let’s start with a quick refresh. A **circle** is like a perfectly round pizza 🍕. The **radius** is the distance from the center to the crust. The **diameter** is twice the radius—it’s like cutting the pizza exactly in half through the center! The **circumference** is the crust’s total length—the distance around the pizza.\n\n**Key Terms in Bold**:\n- **Radius (r)**: Half the diameter.\n- **Diameter (d)**: 2 × radius.\n- **Circumference (C)**: 2 × π × r (where π ≈ 22/7 or 3.14).\n- **Area (A)**: π × r².\n\n**Story Time**: Imagine a bicycle wheel rolling. One full turn = one revolution. If it rolls 11 km in 5000 revolutions, how big is the wheel? We’ll find out!\n\n**Visual Prompt**: Draw a big circle. Color the radius red, the diameter blue, and trace the circumference with a dotted line.\n\n**Memory Aid**: **“Cherry Pie Delicious!”** → C = πd (Circumference = π × diameter).",
      "codeExample": "### Quick Play: Circle Detective 🔍\n\n1. **Fill in the Blanks**:\n   - If radius = 7 cm, diameter = ______ cm.\n   - If circumference = 44 cm, radius = ______ cm (use π = 22/7).\n\n2. **Draw It Out**:\n   - Draw a circle with radius 5 cm. Label radius, diameter, and circumference.\n\n3. **Think About It**:\n   - Why do pizza boxes are square, but pizzas are round? 🤔\n\n4. **Real-World Connection**:\n   - List 3 round objects you see daily (e.g., clock, coin, plate)."

      "content": "## Slices of the Circle Pie\n\nA **sector** is a slice of the pizza. The **arc** is the curved part of the slice’s crust. If you know the slice’s angle at the center (in degrees), you can find its area and arc length!\n\n**Formulas**:\n- **Area of sector** = (θ/360°) × πr²\n- **Length of arc** = (θ/360°) × 2πr\n\n**Analogy**: Your pizza has 8 equal slices. Each slice has a central angle of 45°. If the whole pizza area is 154 cm², one slice’s area = (45/360) × 154.\n\n**Step-by-Step Example**:\n1. Radius = 14 cm, area of sector = 154 cm².\n2. Use: Area = (θ/360) × (22/7) × 14².\n3. Solve for θ, then find arc length.\n\n**Visual Prompt**: Draw a circle divided into 4 sectors. Shade one sector and mark its arc with a bright color.\n\n**Memory Aid**: **“Slice Arc!”** → Sector Area = (θ/360) × πr², Arc Length = (θ/360) × 2πr.",
      "codeExample": "### Slice & Calculate Game 🎲\n\n1. **Practice Questions**:\n   - A sector has angle 60°, radius 10 cm. Find its area and arc length.\n   - True or False: If the sector area is 1/6 of the circle, the angle is 60°.\n\n2. **Interactive Activity**:\n   - Cut a paper circle. Fold it to make sectors of 90°, 120°, 180°. Measure the arc with thread.\n\n3. **Extension Challenge**:\n   - A clock’s minute hand is 7 cm long. What area does it sweep in 20 minutes? (Hint: 20 min = 120°).\n\n4. **Talk to a Friend**:\n   - If you share a circular cake with 3 friends equally, what’s the angle of your slice?"

Let’s solve real puzzles.\n\n**Example 1: Bicycle Wheel**\n- Revolutions = Distance / Circumference.\n- If 5000 rev = 11 km, find circumference, then diameter.\n\n**Example 2: Water Flow in a Pipe**\n- Pipe is a cylinder. Water speed = Volume flowing per second / Cross-section area.\n- Convert units carefully (cm to m, minutes to hours).\n\n**Story Time**: Farmer Ravi has a cylindrical tank 10 m wide, 2 m deep. Water flows from a pipe 20 cm wide at 6 km/h. How long to fill the tank?\n\n**Step-by-Step**:\n1. Find tank volume = πr²h.\n2. Find water volume flowing per hour = π(pipe radius)² × speed.\n3. Time = Tank volume ÷ water flow per hour.\n\n**Visual Prompt**: Draw a tank and a pipe. Label all dimensions. Use arrows to show water flow.\n\n**Positive Reinforcement**: You’re doing amazing! Real-world math makes you a problem-solving superhero! 💪",

      "content": "## Circle Parts & Mixed Shapes\n\nSometimes we need just part of a circle—like a **segment** (a slice minus the triangle). Or shapes made of circles and other figures.\n\n**Segment Area** = Area of sector − Area of triangle.\n\n**Example**: Chord makes 90° at center, radius 14 cm.\n1. Sector area = (90/360) × π×14².\n2. Triangle area = ½ × 14 × 14.\n3. Subtract to get segment area.\n\n**Combined Shapes**: A toy = cone + hemisphere. A bucket = frustum (cut cone).\n\n**Analogy**: An ice-cream cone with a scoop is like cone + hemisphere! 🍦\n\n**Step-by-Step for Frustum**:\n- Slant height = √(height² + (R−r)²).\n- Curved surface area = π(R+r) × slant height.\n\n**Visual Prompt**: Draw a circle. Shade a segment. Draw a frustum (like a bucket). Label top radius (R), bottom radius (r), height (h).\n\n**Memory Aid**: **“Frustum Fun”** → CSA = π(R+r)l.",
